# A-Trajectory-Based-Tennis-Ball-Detection-and-Tracking-System

The project is aimed to detect the tennis ball from live video, Track the tennis ball and predict the tennis ball. As the use of sports robotics grows, new concerns emerge. When we need to implement a tennis-playing robot, for example. The issues listed above must be resolved. Furthermore, because to its drawbacks, we cannot always employ a two-dimensional camera to solve this type of problem. This problem is solved with a two-dimensional camera. This idea could be implemented in the future with a
three-dimensional camera or by converting two-dimensional coordinates to three-dimensional coordinates.
